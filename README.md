# AutismProtectionSystem
The APS project aims at addressing some of the fundemental issues related  to autism, which is most commonly being targeted and subjected to various verbal or even physical abuse.  This is predominently an issue with kids at school.  
 
With the increase usage of social media, this exacerbates the situation further by sharing vile content of their subjects. 

The goal of this project is how can we leverage AI to proactively predict and prevent such horrendous crime of happening in the first place. 

## Potential Approach 

One potential approach is to collect various sensiory data, such as heart rate, temperature, voice, location, and others, and analyze for any anamolies, then establish possible cause and act upon imidiately.
